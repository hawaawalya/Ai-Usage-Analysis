## AI Usage Analysis

This project explores **AI assistant usage** in the context of student
life and everyday decision-making.\
Instead of looking at AI only as a productivity tool, this project takes
a **storytelling approach**:\
*"How do students actually use AI in their lives, and what can we learn
from it?"*

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 📌 Project Orientation

-   **Domain**: Student Life + AI Usage\
-   **Methodology**: Data Analysis & Visualization (Power BI)\
-   **Frameworks**:
    -   Business Understanding → Data Understanding → Visualization →
        Recommendations\
    -   HEART Metrics (Happiness, Engagement, Adoption, Retention, Task
        success)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 🔍 Key Insights

1.  **AI is becoming a daily habit**
    -   Students use AI for quick answers, explanations, and
        brainstorming.\
    -   Similar to how coffee shops become a "third place," AI becomes a
        **digital companion**.
2.  **Usage patterns reflect trust & confidence**
    -   High usage = students see AI as reliable.\
    -   Low/hesitant usage = students fear over-reliance or accuracy
        issues.
3.  **AI is not replacing effort, but shaping effort**
    -   Students still think critically, but AI **lowers the barrier to
        start**.\
    -   Example: writing drafts, coding support, learning math steps.
4.  **Gap between productivity and learning**
    -   Some students use AI only to finish tasks faster → efficiency.\
    -   Others use it as a tutor to **deepen understanding** →
        effectiveness.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 🎯 Recommendations

Based on the analysis, here are the **most effective actions**:

1.  **Position AI like Coffee Shops**
    -   Just as coffee shops provide comfort + productivity, AI should
        be framed as a **supportive partner**, not a replacement.
2.  **Encourage balance between speed & depth**
    -   Design guidelines for students: *Use AI to start, but always
        validate & reflect*.\
    -   Universities can integrate AI into coursework with reflective
        checkpoints.
3.  **Build trust through transparency**
    -   Students want to know: *Where does this answer come from?*\
    -   Future AI tools should add explainability to strengthen trust.
4.  **Promote AI as a "thinking buddy" not a "cheat tool"**
    -   Rebranding AI as a **digital study companion** can reduce
        stigma.

## 🚀 How to Run

1.  Open the Power BI file: `AI_Usage_StudentLife.pbix`\
2.  Explore interactive dashboards\
3.  Read storytelling report for deeper context

## 🌟 Final Note

This project is **not about AI technology itself**---it's about
**students, behavior, and learning**.\
Like coffee, AI can be energizing or overwhelming---what matters is
**how we consume it**.
